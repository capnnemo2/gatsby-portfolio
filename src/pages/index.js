          Obviously this site is still in very early development so that Ben can
          learn Gatsby. That's right, even with all that his brain contains,
          there is room for more. Bring on the Gatsby!

          He's amazing. Seriously, you won't believe how good this guy is. But

        <p>Now we're just adding extra text to see how grid treats this div.</p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, it looks like adding more to this section of the grid
          is stretching the nav portion, which is interestingâ€”and currently
          confusing...

        <p>UPDATE: grid issue resolved. For now. Stay tuned.</p>
